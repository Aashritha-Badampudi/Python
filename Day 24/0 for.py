#For loop
"""
Definition:
-> For loop is used to repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence.
. Repeats for each time.
. Used when sequence is known.
. Automatic iteration.

Basic syntax:
-> "for" variable "in" sequence:
       statement

variable: temporary variable
sequence: list,tuple,string,range etc.
