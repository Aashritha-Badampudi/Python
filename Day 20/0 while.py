as long as a condition is True.

>> Simple meaning:
“Keep doing this WHILE the condition is true.”

syntax:
while condition:
     statement

Condition must be True or False
Code inside must be indented

while repeats code
Condition must change
Stops when condition becomes False
Be careful of infinite loops
break stops loop
continue skips iteration
