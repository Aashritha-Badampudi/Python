"""Nested for loops
A nested loop means:
    A loop inside another loop

In Python:
The outer loop runs first
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs completely

In simple words:
The inner loop finishes all its work every time the outer loop runs once.

Outer Loop vs Inner Loop
🔹 Outer Loop
The main loop
Controls how many times the inner loop will repeat
Runs fewer times compared to inner loop

🔹 Inner Loop
The loop inside the outer loop
Runs completely for each outer loop iteration
Executes more times overall

Outer loop → 1 iteration
   Inner loop → full execution

Outer loop → next iteration
   Inner loop → full execution again
